**Hello, and welcome!** 

I'm Sanjay, a developer and writer from Winnipeg, Canada. Raised in the burbs by wild economists and fueled for years by campus coffee, I've always been fascinated by how empathy and incentives balance in our systems, our tech, and our habits - and how we can learn to be better all the same!

This is where I'll be posting my thoughts about tech I find interesting, its philosophy and impact, how to build better relationships with it, and anything else that inspires me along the way. 

Thank you for stopping by and, genuinely, thank you for reading!
