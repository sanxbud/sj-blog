Hello, and welcome to my space! My name's Sanjay, and I'm a Canadian developer and writer from Winnipeg, Manitoba. 

A bit about me:
- I have degrees in both CS and History and I'd genuinely love to add more - there's so much to learn in this world, and never enough time.
- I have a tendency to joke with basically everything I interact with, whether that be person, animal, or a little rock on the side of the road upon which someone happens to have doodled a smiley face. 
- Empathy and honesty are my core values and the ones I try to live by in everything I do.
- I love solving problems, learning how things work, helping whenever I can, and appreciating the beauty in the ordinary. 

Feel free to hang out here, where I'll be posting my thoughts about tech I find interesting, the philosophy and impact of it, how it makes me feel, and anything else that inspires me along the way. I've always wanted to write and, well, this is the place where it begins. 

Thank you for joining and, genuinely, thank you for reading!
